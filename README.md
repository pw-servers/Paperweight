# Paperweight

**This application is under early active development and should not be used yet.**

Paperweight allows you to manage game servers across any number of remote or local machines.
It provides the affordability of hosting your own server combined with the ease-of-use of
hosting services. For now, we are focusing on Minecraft servers for rich integration, but any
game server can be hooked into the remote console.

This repository hosts the front-end.

Once the application is released or near complete, this README will be updated.
